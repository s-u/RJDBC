    *	RJDBC now supports options that can be defined at driver or
	connection level which affect the defaults to some methods
	such as fetch() or dbGetQuery(). They can be set either as
	additional arguments to JDBC() or as a list passed in
	dbOptions= parameter to dbConnect(). The connections inherit
	driver parameters (if any).

	The options are in principle avaiable to any furhter functions
	and can be checked using the new dbOption() generic which is
	akin to getOption() in R, but it is mostly used by methods in
	RJDBC.

	Options currently used by RJDBC:

	- fetch.block (default: 2048L) - see fetch(block=)
	- fetch.lossy (default: FALSE) - see fetch(lossy=)
	- fetch.posix.ts (default: TRUE) - see fetch(posix.ts=)
	- fetch.tz (default: "") - see fetch(tz=)

	For example, to allow lossy numeric conversions for all
	connections of a given driver, it is possible to load the
	driver such as

	JDBC("org.postgresql.Driver", "postgresql-42.3.3.jar",
	     fetch.lossy=TRUE)

	Similarly, it is possible to do so only for particular
	connections, such as if the MySQL driver was loaded without
	such option then

	dbConnect(MySQL, "jdbc:mysql://localhost/foo",
	   dbOptions=list(fetch.lossy=TRUE))

   *	fetch() (and by extension dbGetQuery() and dbReadTable())
	gains new arguments:

	lossy: logical, if FALSE (default) then result columns that
	  contain decimals that may not be representable in IEEE
	  double format are returned as string. If TRUE then any
	  numeric or decimal values are converted to doubles even if
	  that may result in loss of presision. (see also #92)

	posix.ts: logical, if TRUE (default) then result columns with
	  data/time values are fetched as timestamps in POSIX
	  form. This is most efficient and identical to POSIXct
	  representation in R, but it relies on drivers and DBMS
	  handling time zones properly. If FALSE then values are
	  returned as strings which is less effient, but may be easier
	  to uncover issues in data/time handling.

	tz: string, defaults to "" which denotes R's current time
	  zone. Specifies the time zone in which the resulting POSIXct
	  data should be displayed (same as using .POSIXct(x, tz=tz)).
	  Note that this is only relevant for pringin, the actual
	  timestamps is always an absolute point in time, but may be
	  shown in different time zones.


0.2-11
    *	add field.types= argument to dbWriteTable() (#87)


0.2-10	2022-03-24
    *	dbSendQuery() and dbSendUpdate() now remove named arguments
	only from `...` but not from `list=` to enable single-row
	updates from data frames along the lines of `list=iris[1,]`.

    *	dbWriteTable() failed for data frames with exactly one row,
	because it used the form shown above for updates which will
	fail with `JDBC ERROR: Parameter at position 1 is not set`
	since all elements are named and thus none were set.

    *	merging arguments from `...` and `list=` was not always done
	correctly, in some cases `list=` would overwrite `...`
	arguments.

	(Note: all of the above are 0.2-9 regressions related to the
	changes in handling of prepared statement arguments)

    *	add dbIsValid() methods for JDBCConnection and JDBCResult (#89)


0.2-9	2022-03-16
    *	All Java-related errors are signalled by throwing error
	conditions. If a Java error occurred, the condition will be of
	the class JDBC.exception with the Java class names of the
	excption as subclasses. Such objects have following slots:
	 - desc: string, description of the operation error
	 - jex: Java object, reference to the Java exception object
	 - statement: string (or NULL), executed statement
	This allows the programmatic use of tryCatch() to selectively
	catch exceptions and/or to use further Java utilities, such as
	e$jex$printStackTrace()

    *	add `schema=` to `dbExistsTable()` (#84)

    *	check precision of numeric types and revert to string
	representation if it is more than 15 to avoid loss of
	precision at conversion time. (#83)

    *	`NA`s are supported in updates (#64)

    *	add `findDrivers()` function which uses Java Service Provider
	mechanism (in Java 1.6 and higher) to find all JDBC driver
	classes on the class path.

    *	dbConnection() used to always try DriverManager first
	(without properties) and only on failure it would use the
	driver. However, DriverManager is static and never updates the
	driver list, so it is inherently unreliable. Therefore we now
	prefer the driver if specified and DriverManager will only be
	used if the driver is NULL. (inspired by #45)

    *	Use collect + join when `fetch()`ing results of unknown
	length. This should improve performance for fetching results
	with large number of rows. (mentioned in #50)

    *	Named arguments are removed from `dbSendUpdate` and query
	calls when populating prepared statements to allow for future
	named arguments in the methods.

    *	`dbBegin()` is implemented to disable auto-commit. Analogously,
	`dbRollback()` and `dbCommit()` perform the corresponding
	function and then re-enable auto-commit. (see also #58)

    *	`dbReadTable()` passes ... through to `dbGetQuery`


0.2-8	2020-03-06
    *	re-use Java helper for subsequent fetch() calls on the same
	result set which should make them more efficient.

    *	set `has.completed` only if the fetch() has encountered
	end of the result set (#73)

    *	add `use.label` argument to fetch() - if set to `FALSE`
	then column names are used instead of labels (#74)

    *	change both semantics and defaults for `append=FALSE` and
	`overwrite=FALSE` in dbWriteTable() to match what is
	documented in `DBI`: append=TRUE no longer requires the
	existence of the target table and the options are mutally
	exclusive (i.e. append=TRUE, overwrite=TRUE is illegal).

    *	dbWriteTable() also gains `force=TRUE` option (disabled by
	default) which skips the existence check for the target and
	proceeds with removal and/or insertion regardless. This can be
	useful with append=TRUE where the target is not a table and
	thus would not pass the dbExistsTable() check (see #27).

    *	dbRemoveTable() returns TRUE on success (#20). On failure it
	will fail with an error if silent=FALSE (as it always did so
	far) or return FALSE if silent=TRUE.

    *	JDBC errors are reported such that the statement is shown at
	the end. Previously the statement preceded the JDBC error, so
	long statements caused errors to be truncated (#32). This also
	opens up the possibility of more structured error objects.

    *	n, block and use.label are now passed through from
        dbGetQuery() to fetch() (#44)


0.2-7	2018-01-24
    *	cosmetic changes to appease CRAN


0.2-6	2018-01-05
    *	move java-src to java

    *	add schema= argument to dbGetTables() and dbListTables()

    *	support vectorized version of dbSendUpdate() which uses
	batch-inserts for more efficient loading. Note that only
	prepared statements work for now.

    *	use column labels instead of names (#36)

    *	dbColumnInfo() will return the column label in `name' and
	column name in `field.name' (which is optional, for
	compatbility).


0.2-5	2014-12-18
    *	fix bug in dbUnloadDriver() returning NULL instead of FALSE

    *	added block argument to fetch() currently defaulting to 2048
	which controls the fetch size.
	Note that 0.2-4 has set this to the stride which was much too
	big for some databases therefore it is now configurable.
	(issue #10)

    *	recover if setFetchSize() fails since some drivers don't take
	it as a hint and fail regardless (issue #11)


0.2-4	2014-06-26
    *	set fetch size to match the capacity for better performance
	with some drivers. (thanks Jesse Rohland)

    *	close DB objects explicitly (issue #4) to avoid Oracle DB
	running out of resources

    *	add support for dbHasCompleted() even in older DBI versions


0.2-3	2013-12-12
    *	fix duplicate connection object (issue #1)


0.2-2	2013-12-03
    *	add dbGetTables() and dbGetFields() which are similar to
	dbListTable() and dbListFields() but return a full data frame
	as obtained from the corresponding JDBC calls.

    *	add support for stored procedure call JDBC syntax.
	Currently only IN parameters are supported since
	DBI doesn't provide a way to retrieve OUT parameters.

    *	JDBC now uses path.expand() on the classPath components


0.2-1	2012-11-30
    *	add support for dbWriteTable(..., append=TRUE)

    *	pass any additional arguments to dbConnect() as properties to
	the connection

    *	use prepared statements only if parameters are passed,
	otherwise use simple statements (this allows to work around
	bugs in	drivers that do not support prepared statements
	properly)

    *	dbGetQuery() explicitly closes the statement before it returns
	to work arround issues in the Teradata driver.


0.2-0	2011-05-16
    *	use Java code to fetch results -- it should result in much higher
	throughput in pulling result sets from the database. It is
	also more efficient to use fetch() with n specified
	(especially if you know it in advance) than relying on
	n = -1. The latter will try first run with n = 32k and then
	continue with n = 512k chunks and paste the results which is
	inherently slow (still much faster than the 0.1-x way which
	was fetching one record at a time).


0.1-6	2011-03-09
    *	fix a typo in dbClearResult

    *	map NAs in query parameters into NULLs
	(thanks to Axel Klenk)

    *	explicitly close statements right away (Oracle seems to need this)
	(thanks to Axel Klenk)

    *	add "stat" slot (Statement object) to JDBCResult class to make sure
	the statement lives long enough to not close the result set

    *	convert NULLs into NAs in numeric columns

0.1-5	2007-10-01
    *	instantiate driver's class and use a call to 'connect' as a
	fall-back if the DriverManager fails to find a proper driver.

    *	fix SQL syntax in dbWriteTable (superfluous semicolon)

    *	fix a typo in prepared statement code
	(thanks to Carl Grant for the last two bugfixes)

0.1-4	2007-03-05
    *	added SQL error information to most JDBC errors

    *	use .jfindClass to load drivers

0.1-3	2007-02-21
    *	remove beforeFirst() as some DBMS don't like it. This also
	allows a sequential use of fetch() with a limit to load data
	in chunks.

    *	fix a bug that caused NULL entries in string columns to fail
	in fetch()

0.1-2	2007-01-23
    *	fix dbDisconnect return value and update manuals

0.1-1	2007-01-17
    *	added pre-compiled statements and proper dbWriteTable

0.1-0	(not released)
    *	drop pgsql access, switch to DBI

0.0-3	2006-03-05
    *	add direct insert support for pgsql

0.0-2	2005-10-12
    *	added converson of tables to data.frames

0.0-1	2005-05-02
    *	added type conversion (int, double, string)

0.0-0	2004-11-02
    *	first public release
